This repository offers a pipeline to study the physiological effects of an infusion given during an MRI scan on individuals with mood disorders. It enables the collection, processing, and analysis of data like heart rate (HR), helping researchers explore the infusion's impact on physiological parameters related to mood disorder symptoms.
## Data Collection
Data(HR and respiratory rate) was collected during MRI scans 
This data was saved using the bids format https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/physiological-and-other-continuous-recordings.html 
## Study Design and Time points 
Our study is a double blind cross over study with sub anethisic dose of ketamine(0.5 mg/kg) and saline as the placebo
